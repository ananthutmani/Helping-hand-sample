The main page Index has 3 subsidiary webpages created by me. They are the webpage More.html, Delivery.html and verify.html.

From the main page "index" these can be accessed by clicking the Visit Website link in the card elements under Services in the case of Advanced No Contact Delivery System (Delivery.html) and Fact Verification (verify.html), and through the View More button (more.html).

All links in the main page are working. They have been linked either to the 3 extra pages I created or to other relevant government and non government websites.

In case of the sub-page opened after clicking view more in the list of services(More.html), the page that opens up has all links working except the ones labelled "More Info"

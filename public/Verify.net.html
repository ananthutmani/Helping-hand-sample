                    Verify.net is an online service that verifies news spread through social media like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram etc. Our organization was formed to combat the intense spread of misinformation through these mainstream pages, thus reducing the issues caused due to these fake statements. Users can enter their doubts or the facts they recieved in their social media accounts, upon which vour staff will sweep through the database to match this to a previous entry or create a new one. We will then forward this information to the expert in the field of enquiry and get their opinion, which will be sent to the email you used to create your account in Verify.net. The enquiry will also be made public if more than 40% of that day's user enquires were the same as the one you sent us so that the truth can be revealed to all.

"After December 31, 2019 you cannot change your Rs 2,000 notes," a viral WhatsApp post read. That, however, is completely untrue, as the Press Information Bureau (PIB) clarified later.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">WhatsApp has been criticised for its inability to keep a check on the circulation of fake news on its platform. But the company itself became a victim of fake news after messages claiming that WhatsApp use is going to be restricted in India during night as a part of new policy by Narendra Modi government began doing the rounds. These messages were in fact triggered after WhatsApp suffered downtime on the night of July 3. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">After the rape and murder of a veterinary doctor in Hyderabad sparked outrage across India, messages on WhatsApp began doing the rounds saying the Modi government has passed a new law— Section 233 of Indian Penal Code— to tackle crimes against women. That, however, was fake, since the government hadn't done anything of the sort and Section 233 already exists, but it pertains to punishment for counterfeit coins.</p>
